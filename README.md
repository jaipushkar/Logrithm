# Logrithm
**Overview**
This project involves the analysis and visualization of revenue data from a dataset contained in Revenue.xlsx. The primary objective is to load the data, display initial rows, and visualize the revenue distribution of various companies using bar plots, both on a regular and logarithmic scale.

**Datasets**
Revenue.xlsx: This dataset contains revenue information of different companies.

**Steps**
**Data Loading:**
Load the Revenue.xlsx file into a pandas DataFrame.
Display the first 10 rows of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

**Data Visualization:**
Create a bar plot to visualize the revenue of different companies.
Create a logarithmic scale bar plot to better understand the distribution of revenue values, especially when there are large differences between company revenues.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib

**Usage**
Data Analysis: The provided code snippets load the data and display the first 10 rows to give an initial overview of the dataset.
Data Visualization: The code generates bar plots for the revenue data, allowing for both regular and logarithmic visualizations to accommodate a wide range of revenue values.
